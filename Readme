QR-ROM: 

Converts a file into QR-Codes for data storage and vice versa


Disclaimer:
-This program is just for experimental use
-Don't use it as a single backup


Explanation:
 QR-ROM write : converts a binary file into a base64 format. It is splitted into files each the same size (e.g. 1500 Bytes) 
 				Those are converted into QR-Codes which are montaged in 3x4 images
 
 QR-ROM read : reads out all montaged QR-Codes by using zbarimg and extract*. Both are used to read the data and bring it back
 				 in the correct order.
 				 


Usage:

QR-ROM.sh write Inputfile OutputDirectory

	creates from the Inputfile into OutputDirectory png files, which can be printed


QR-ROM.sh read Inputdirectory Outputdirectry
	
	restores from the scanned images in Inputdirectory the original file in Outputdirectory
	
	

additional Information:
	The montage size should be adjusted, if the scanner or printer has an inferior imageresolution.
	Also try different settings for the split size for writing the data
